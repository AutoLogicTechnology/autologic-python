# Autologic Python

Manage Python installations from source. RedHat/RHEL based systems usually ship with Python 2.6 which is designed to work as a core OS component, not run user scripts/applications. This Role helps ease the management of a custom Python installation.

Defaults to Python 2.7.9, but this can be configured.

## Variables

```yaml
autologic_python_version: "2.7.9"

```
